Published in : 'Metis' 

Description : 'This quantlet was originally writen by Eliza Zinovyeva which is also available on Quantlet repository under HClustering. The current code is modified for application of Spectral Clustering on the same data using the same methodology.

Generally, the code uses the keywords from Quantlet data, tokenizes the words to vectors and applies spectral clustering using scikit python library to cluster the quantlets into different number of clusters. It also uses PCA and TSNE for visualisation of the clusters'

Keywords : 'Quantlet, Graph theory, spectral clustering, clustering, plot, animation, laplacian, graph, eigenvalues, K means, noisy circles, scikit learn, PCA, TSNE'
